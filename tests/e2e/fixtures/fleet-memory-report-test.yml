      TODO: ask about Q2 roadmap
      Meeting notes 2024-03-01: discussed pricing, client wants discount
      IMPORTANT: old API key was rotated, ignore ref abc-123
      Bug: user reported 404 on /dashboard — FIXED 2024-04 but leaving note here
      Random thought: maybe we should track feature requests somewhere else
      Client asked about competitor X pricing on 2024-02-10 — no block for this
      Note to self: this block is getting messy, should split into meeting-notes and action-items
      Pricing: $99/mo enterprise — WAIT this changed to $149/mo in Jan 2025
      Old onboarding checklist (probably outdated):
      1. Send welcome email 2. Schedule kickoff 3. Share docs folder
      Duplicate: client is on Enterprise plan (already in client_info block)
